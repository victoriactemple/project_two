# Project Two 
## Up the Garden Path - a Plant Inventory Tracker for Your Personal Garden

#### Technologies Used:
* Handlebars
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* NodeJS
* Express
* Heroku
* JavaScript
* Jquery
* CSS
* Materialize
* Photoshop

##### Functionality
This application will allow you to keep track of the plants in your garden -- presently, only your herb garden. A user can jump on and add plants, update their description plants, and manage the cost and quantity. 


#### For the Future: 
* Restful Routing for creating another garden -- vegetable, fruit, squash, etc. 
* User input on the images that are generated. Perhaps they can select from a list of prefilled images via a dropdown menu. 
* Ability to upload your garden layout or create it on the page.
* Map that shows where in your garden these plants are planted.
