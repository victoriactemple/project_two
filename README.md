#### Technologies Used:

* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* NodeJS
* Express
* Heroku
* JavaScript
* Jquery
* CSS
* Materialize
* Photoshop
* Trello

##### Functionality:
This application will allow you to keep track of the plants in your garden -- presently, only your herb garden. A user can jump on and add plants, update their description plants, and manage the cost and quantity. 
Three models, garden, plants, and users. Plants and Users are fully built out - complete restful routes for each.



#### For the Future: 
* Restful Routing for creating another garden -- vegetable, fruit, squash, etc. 
* User input on the images that are generated. Perhaps they can select from a list of prefilled images via a dropdown menu. 
* Ability to upload your garden layout or create it on the page.
* Map that shows where in your garden these plants are planted.
* User's being integrated into the site more so that when they login, they are updating their own garden and no one elses. 
* User's name be displayed when the user signs in
